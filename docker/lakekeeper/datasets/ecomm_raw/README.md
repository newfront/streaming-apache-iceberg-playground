This exploration utilizes the hard work put into the [ECommerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store) dataset from Kaggle. Thanks to [Michael Kechinov](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov) for providing this great dataset.

When you download the dataset, you'll find the following files:
```
2019-Oct.csv (5.67 GB)
2019-Nov.csv (9.01 GB)
```

This is enough data to successfully saturate the gRPC network between the client <> server. Have fun!
